# House-Pricing-ML
# About the Project
This project is designed to predict house prices using a Linear Regression model based on various property features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and available amenities like air conditioning and parking. The project leverages a real-world dataset and involves thorough data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

# Key Features:
- Feature Selection: Uses important real estate features such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities (air conditioning, parking, etc.) to build the prediction model.
- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing data and categorical features through encoding techniques to ensure the model performs optimally.
- Model Building: Implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.
- Evaluation Metrics: Evaluates the model performance using common metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the RÂ² score to measure prediction accuracy.
- Data Visualization: Includes visual representations of model performance such as actual vs predicted prices and residual plots.

# Use Case:
This project is highly beneficial for individuals in the real estate market, including buyers, sellers, and agents, to predict house values based on a set of features. By providing data-driven insights, it allows users to make more informed decisions when buying or selling properties.
